1. Big O for the Algorithm
The time complexity is O(n*m)

n is the length of the text,
m is the length of the pattern.
 the algorithm will check every character in the text for every character in the pattern. The nested loops contribute to the quadratic nature of the time complexity.

2. Alignment of Elapsed Time Calculations

The best-case scenario (when the pattern is found at the beginning) is faster than the worst-case scenario when the pattern is found at the end or not at all
 observe that the elapsed time for the best case is considerably lower than for the worst case but elapsed time in nanoseconds is highly dependent on the execution environment and may vary.


The best-case scenario typically runs in O(m). m is the length of the pattern
The worst-case scenario runs in O(n*m) is consistent with the brute-force nature of the algorithm.

3. Purpose of the Exercise

Illustrate how best or worst scenarios can affect the performance of an algorithm.
Provide a practical understanding of Big O notation and how it relates to actual execution time.
Help learners develop skills in measuring and analyzing performance for algorithms, reinforcing theoretical concepts with real-world examples.
4. Is This Enough to Calculate Best and Worst-Case Scenarios?
While this exercise provides a solid basis for understanding best and worst-case scenarios, it might not be exhaustive for all contexts. Itâ€™s sufficient to demonstrate:

Best-case scenario: When the pattern is found immediately this lead to quick resolution.
Worst-case scenario: When the pattern is not found until the last possible moment or is absent this lead to maximum iterations.
